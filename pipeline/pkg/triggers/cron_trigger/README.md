# CRON Trigger

This CRON trigger is based on [github.com/robfig/cron](https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron). It differs from the default CRON because it includes
seconds, much like the Quartz CRON commonly used in Java.

The CRON Trigger by default will be triggered in the machines local time.
