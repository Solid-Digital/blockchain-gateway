### Which changes should the reviewer focus on, if any?
Example:
#### Adding CrazyNewDatabase
- `CrazyNewDatabase` uses 50% of available memory on idle,
perhaps the configuration isn't optimal for the server ABC.
- Could not find documentation on backing up `CrazyNewDatabase` will keeping it
online, can we tolerate database downtime?
