# Polling Station

This is a sample distributed application (DApp). Use it together with [unchain.io](https://www.unchain.io) and the [Unchain Adapter for Ethereum](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07J2VJHMV?qid=1542719576256) for an easy-to-use integration with Blockchain.

The app itself is a polling station, registering votes to the Blockchain and using Facebook as the (example) identity provider. It allows every (facebook) user to vote exactly once.
